# PCRsi.V0 🔬

PCRsi.V0 is a demo version of a primer design GUI application powered by Python.  
This tool is designed for basic input-output visualization and will evolve to integrate NCBI, Primer3, and BLAST.

## 🧬 Features

- Simple GUI for primer input
- Randomized primer sequence generation (demo purpose)
- Desktop executable (Windows)

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- Integration with NCBI API
- Use real sequence data from GenBank/EMBL
- Primer3/BLAST automation
- Clinical diagnostics tool design support

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download the `.exe` file from [Releases](https://github.com/gyrdla/PCRsi.V0/releases).
2. Run on Windows 8/10/11.
3. Enter input and get simulated primer suggestions.

## 🤝 Contribution

This is an early-stage prototype. Contributions and ideas are welcome.
